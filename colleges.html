			<td>Level 1 Vocational Studies</td>
			<td>I originally began by studying Level 1 Mechanics and was kicked out after 2 weeks, they claimed my back was a liability and that I could sue them if it gave way during class.
			<br>And so began my extended hatred of education
			<br>I was then forced to go on another Level 1 course were my only choices were either LEvel 1 Vocational Studies or Hair and Beauty and since Hair and Beauty was even further away from my goal of being a mechanic I decided to go with Vocational Studies.
			<br>My thinking was at least I will get some use out of Vocational Studies</td>
